|| @description
|| | This is a graphical demonstration that runs on an LED strip.
|| | In this demonstration, a one-dimensional LED strip displays a two-dimensional cellulat automaton.
|| | Specifically, it uses position as one dimension, and color as the second.
|| | The rule set is identical to Conway's Game of Life, though the interpretation is quantized rather than discrete.
